                                <p> Copyright exists to protect original works and is automatically applied when works are created, typically lasting until 50 years after the author's death, although this is dependent on the type of work that is copyrighted.<br><br>
                                    1. The Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) licence is the most lenient of the CC licences, allowing for the distribution, modification, and adaptation of a creative work, personally or commercially, as long as credit is given to the original author/s.<br>
                                    2. The Attribution-NoDerivs (CC BY-ND) licence gives permission to reuse a creative work for any purpose, be it personal or commercial, but only if the material has not been adapted (I.e., it remains in its original form) and appropriate credit is given.<br>
                                    3. The Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs (CC BY-NC-ND) offers the least freedom of the Creative Commons licences. A work with this licence may only be downloaded and shared with others if the original author is credited. The work cannot be modified, adapted, or used commercially.<br><br> 
                                    In New Zealand copyright law, "fair use" applies when copyrighted material is copied for the purpose of critical analysis / reviewing, reporting news, or for academic research. Media such as music may be copied for personal use, with certain limitations.

                                <img src="https://www.business2community.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/google-logo-seo.jpg" alt="Google SEO">

                                <p> 1. Populating a website with commonly-searched keywords and phrases can make it appear more frequently in search results. These words and phrases can be placed in the title tags, headings, main body content, image tags, menu bars, etc.<br>
                                    2. Providing inbound links on external websites, such as business directories or written articles, is one method of directing traffic to a website. The more attention that a website receives, the higher it will rank in web searches.<br> 
                                    3. Developing a website with "clean" HTML code will make it more appealing to Google's web crawling bots, e.g., Googlebot. Clean code is optimised and tidy, compared to HTML that is messy, bloated, or unresponsive (not user-friendly).<br> 
                                    4. Writing an interesting meta description (text displayed under the title and URL in search results) for a website will give potential visitors an idea of what the website's purpose and features are, making them more likely to click the link than they would be otherwise.<br>    
                                    5. Designing a website to be optimised for mobile devices will cater to majority of internet users who browse on smartphones or tablets. Websites that are not responsive / mobile-friendly will not be as highly recommended by Google, making a mobile-first approach an ideal choice.

                                <p> 1. The monetary costs of a paid web hosting plan, such as the price of signing up and renewing a subscription. If intending to pay for a plan, it is advisable to research the costs beforehand and find out if a refund policy and / or free trial is offered before making a decision.<br>
                                    2. The features and functionality offered by a web hosting provider. Providers may offer useful tools to assist with file and DNS management. A hosting plan could also allow a client to upgrade their server if necessary (if a domain receives high traffic, for instance) and create backups for a website incase problems arise.<br>
                                    3. The performance of a web host is a major factor in maintaining a successful website. One should examine the server uptime of a provider to gauge stability. The current industry standard is 99.95% server uptime, and any less is considered unreliable. Server responsiveness should also be taken into consideration. Fast server speeds are essential for user experience and search engine optimisation.

                                <p>1. Dos and DDoS Attacks: A denial-of-service (DoS) attack is designed to overwhelm the resources of a system to the point where it is unable to reply to legitimate service requests. A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is similar in that it also seeks to drain the resources of a system. These can potentially be prevented via firewalls and surface area reduction.<br>
								2. Phishing Attacks: A phishing attack occurs when a malicious actor sends emails that seem to be coming from trusted, legitimate sources in an attempt to grab sensitive information from the target. These can be prevented by protecting your device with security software or multi-factor authentication.<br>
								3. Ransomware: With ransomware, the victim’s system is held hostage until they agree to pay a ransom to the attacker. After the payment has been sent, the attacker then provides instructions regarding how the target can regain control of their computer. These can be prevented with VPNs when using unsafe download sources.<br>
								4. Trojan Horses: A Trojan horse attack uses a malicious program that is hidden inside a seemingly legitimate one. When the user executes the presumably innocent program, the malware inside the Trojan can be used to open a backdoor into the system through which hackers can penetrate the computer or network. This can be prevented with anitvirus software.<br>
								5. Malware Attacks: Malware is a general term for malicious software. Malware infects a computer and changes how it functions, destroys data, or spies on the user or network traffic as it passes through. Malware can either spread from one device to another or remain in place, only impacting its host device. These can be prevented with any or all of the above menthods.
